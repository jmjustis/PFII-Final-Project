# PFII-Final-Project
The final project for my programming foundations II class was a console expression evaluation project programmed in C++.
For this final project, we had to combine many of the skills we have learned over the past semester to create an extensive program that takes in expressions and can perform a multitude of actions on those expressions.  This program is interactive meaning it takes input from the user and gives an output.  The input would be a series of expressions separated be semicolons.  These expressions could be arithmetic as well as assignment of variables.  Expressions are a series of repeating operators and operands, and each expression had to be validated before it could be solved.  For each expression it also had to be determined the postfix and prefix form as well as fully parenthesized.  The program also needed to store the information for variable assignment and use that variable assignment to solve other expressions containing those variables.
